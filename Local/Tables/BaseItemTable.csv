If I could name it, I would call it the Blessed Lands, because it truly is a place of great blessings.\nIn my youth, I was a rash and foolish man, the youngest son of a minor noble of Poitain. At that age I was consumed by my love of wealth and status and I drank and gambled with other young men of questionable character.\nEventually my father, when confronted with my gambling debts, gave me no choice. He simply shipped me off to a monastery, to contemplate my sins.\nI was not an admirable monk, I confess freely. More concerned with my own amusement than the state of my soul, I often stole from the monastery by night and returned with stolen casks of ale and food. I was popular among the other monks, of course, but the Abbot began to see my influence upon his entire congregation.\nEventually, he decided to be rid of me.\nOne night I awoke, bound hand and foot with sturdy ropes, while two burly men lifted me from my bunk and carried me down the winding stone staircase of the monastery. The Abbot accompanied them, wringing his hands and pleading to me with his eyes.\n?My child, the choice breaks my heart, but I am losing the others. These men will take you away, somewhere far away, where you can start a new life away from your father or Mitra. It will be the best for this monastery and the best for you. Tell me that you understand?? he pleaded.\n?What if they decided to slit my throat, Abbot? Then my death will be on your hands.? I spat.\n?I have assurances that they will not.? He glanced nervously at the men carrying me. ?I wish you the best of your new life, child?. He turned away.\nI was put into the back of a wagon, covered with a sackcloth, and left to my terrified thoughts.\nFor how long I traveled, I cannot say. I was passed from one set of hands to another, always with the clink of gold to seal the exchange. Other captives joined me in the wagon ? men and women from different lands. Some were nobleman, some were commoners. All were as confused as I was about where we were going and why. Most of us assumed that our captors were Shemitish slavers.\nOn the last night of my old life, we were given our rations, a thick heavy stew of vegetables and meat. Like the others, I ate ravenously. And like the others, when whatever poison they had put into the food kicked in, the darkness swallowed me.\nThe next day, my new life began.\nI awoke, stripped naked, in the sands of a vast desert. There were no people to be seen, just some ruins and the vast emptiness of the sands. I was disoriented, but I chose a direction and set out, hoping to find anybody or anything.\nI almost died. A sandstorm came sweeping in, swirling sand and lightning and I fled before it, taking shelter in the shadow on an old tumbled statue.\nThere were beasts in the sandstorm. I could hear them moving around and howling with the screeching wind.\nI repented my life then, thinking of my family for the first time in years.I prayed to Mitra to protect my soul and I forgave the Abbot, who had been a good man trying to protect his flock.\nMitra spoke to me then, and his words were for me alone. He wrapped me in his presence, and kept the creatures from finding me. I gave myself wholly to Mitra, there in the darkest hour of my life. \nI came from the desert a new man and, guided by Mitra, I found this place. This shrine is dedicated to my god and to every Exiled soul, far from home and weary, who could use a place to rest.\nI leave this story here in the hope that it will inspire others. I have gone ahead, deeper into the Exiled Lands. Mitra has told me that there is much work to do.\n"")","/Game/UI/Textures/Icons/icon_scrawled_note.icon_scrawled_note","/Script/ConanSandbox.GameItem","None","/Game/Items/GatheringResources/Rock1.Rock1_C","None","1","0","Consumable","0.000000","0","None","OneHanded","","0","0","0","0","0.000000","0.000000","0.500000","0.000000","0.000000","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0.000000","0.000000","0.000000","0.000000","0.000000","1","0.000000","0","0","0","0","Default","0","0","0","None","None","None","0","0","0","0.000000","0","-1.000000","0","0","1","0","0","1","0","0","1","0","0","0","","","","","0","0","0.000000","0","0","None","-1"

Bah, I should have listened to my instincts. But how could I have foreseen \nthis? Every now and then a deal goes sour and if your wit and sword are sharp, you can usually land on \nyour feet, but this? \nThe notice was under the seal of King Ctesphon himself, calling for adventurers and mercenaries \ninterested in making good gold for little work to meet at the central plaza in Khemi. I was out of work \nand out of coin and there was nothing odd about the notice. Every so often the bandits who haunt the \ndesert highways grow too bold and the King hires a small army of ruffians to scare them back into their \nhideouts for a while. It\'s boring work out in the desert with nary a whore or tavern in sight, but it pays \nwell and bandits are more interested in running away from overwhelming odds than fighting so your \nchances of coming back again are pretty good. Better than any war I\'ve ever fought in.\nIn any case, I thought this would be the same thing. But it wasn\'t.\nQuite a few of us gathered at the muster in the square - mostly Stygian, of course, but there were a few \nfreebooters from the northern lands. They stood in their own little group, some distance from the rest \nof us, looking uneasy.\nThe royal guards showed up and cleared a space in the center of the square for the royal herald.\n\""We\'re looking for treasure hunters\"" he announced, looking around the square at the assorted scum \nthat the summons had gathered. \""We\'ve discovered the ruins of an ancient city and we need those souls \nbrave enough to travel into the ruins and recover all of treasures found therein. For every treasure that \nyou recover, you will be paid a sum of gold. The ruins are, as far as we can tell, uninhabited. Because we \ndon\'t want the whereabouts of these ruins - and the treasure- to become common knowledge, if you \nagree to join us there are three conditions.\nFirstly, you will be blindfolded and transported by wagon to the ruins.\nSecondly, you will be not be allowed to have contact with anybody outside of the ruins while you are \nthere.\nAnd finally, you will wear one of these.\"" He was holding up a golden bracelet, which glinted with a green \njewel. I was too far away to make out much detail but I remember thinking immediately that the price of \nthe bracelet - if it was real - was worth taking the job for anyway.\n\""What\'s the trick?\"" A burly, leather-clad man holding a fearsome looking maul demanded. I agreed. \nSomething was not right here. This all sounded far too good to be true.\n\""The trick\"" said a black robed man, pushing past the royal herald to confront the mercenary who had \nshouted, \""is really very simple.\"" He lifted an arm, and it was clear that he was holding a golden bracelet \nexactly like the one that the herald had been holding a moment before.\n\""If you try to keep anything you find in the ruins, or you run away from the ruins with the thought that \nyou might sell this bracelet - you will be punished\"" The man in the black robe flicked his hand and it \nwasn\'t a golden bracelet he was holding, but a small golden snack with glittering green eyes. He threw it \nfull in to the face of the burly mercenary.\nThe man shrieked and clawed at his face, but it was far too late. He began to convulse, frothing at the \nmouth and turning a dreaful pale color. He fell to the ground, still twitching.\nThe man in the black robe stepped over the dying man, and picked up the glittering snake from the \nground. By the time he did, it was simply a bracelet once more.\nThe crowd murmured uneasily. We were used to the priests of Set and their bloody knives, but such \nblatant sorcery implied a pact with even darker powers, the type of pact that stains a mans soul in \ndarkness that can never be erased.\n\""Now, if our terms are acceptable to you, please step forward.\"" The royal herald has stepped forward to \ntalk to the crowd again, the black robed sorcerer had withdrawn back behind the guards.\nAbout half of the crowd moved toward the herald immediately, eager for the adventure. Quite a few \npeople left immediately, clearly disquieted by the demonstration of power that they had seen.\nI lingered. I\'m not a superstitious man, but I knew there were things beyond my understanding in this \nworld and I wanted no part of them. \nOn the other hand, my purse was hanging limply at my side and my lips were parched for lack of strong \ndrink.\nI should have listened to my instincts. But I chose the path of the fool, and now I am destined to die in \nthe Exiled Lands.
